# Autopilot Automation Website

A lightweight, multi-page marketing site for Autopilot Automation (`autopilotautomation.io`). Built with semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and a dash of vanilla JavaScript to power navigation and form interactions.

## Pages
- `index.html` – Home / overview
- `services.html` – Detailed services and deliverables
- `about.html` – Background, mission, and approach
- `case-studies.html` – Sample outcomes and proof points
- `contact.html` – Inquiry form and direct email details

## Local Development
1. From the project root, start a static server (any tool works). Example using Python:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Visit `http://localhost:8000/index.html` (and the other `.html` files) in your browser.
3. Edit the HTML/CSS/JS files and refresh the browser to see changes. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`.
